            It's unique to Automated Market Makers (AMMs) like Uniswap & Curve. When you LP you 
            are providing tokens to be used as a counter-party when someone wants to buy or sell a token. `}</Text>

            <Text>{`In exchange for providing liquidity, LPs receive fees on each trade. This can 
            be very profitable for LPs on token pairs with high volume. However it can be risky 
            to be an LP as high fluctuations in price may mean that you end up with less value in 
            the long run, even when accounting for trading fees.`}</Text>
